# How ROT.CLUB Works

## Create Political Cartoon Dialogues in Minutes

ROT.CLUB transforms political discourse into entertaining animated conversations featuring real political figures. Here's how our platform works:

### 1. Choose Your Topic
Start by entering any political topic, current event, or controversial subject you want to explore. Our AI understands context and can generate relevant dialogue for any scenario.

**Examples:**
- "Who gets the last pop-tart"
- "Debate about climate change policy"
- "Discussion about social media regulation"

### 2. Set Character Perspectives
For each political figure (Trump, Zelensky, JD Vance), define what they care about or their stance on the topic. This helps our AI generate authentic-sounding dialogue that matches their known positions and speaking styles.

**Example Setup:**
- **Trump cares about:** "Making the best deals and American greatness"
- **Zelensky cares about:** "Ukrainian independence and fighting corruption"
- **Vance cares about:** "Working-class American struggles"

### 3. AI Generates the Script
Our advanced AI analyzes each character's speaking patterns, political positions, and personality traits to create a realistic 4-part dialogue sequence:
- Trump's opening statement
- Zelensky's response
- Trump's counter-argument
- Vance's final perspective

### 4. Voice Synthesis & Animation
Each character's dialogue is converted to speech using specialized voice models that match their actual speaking style, including:
- Speech patterns and cadence
- Accent and pronunciation
- Argumentative delivery style

The voices are synchronized with pre-animated video clips of each character.

### 5. Watch & Share
Your completed "ROT" (political cartoon) is ready to watch! The 30-second animated sequence plays automatically, featuring:
- Seamless scene transitions
- Synchronized audio and video
- Character-authentic dialogue delivery
