âœ… Observations and Suggestions
1. Deprecation of fs.exists
In your video.ts file, you're using fs.exists, which has been deprecated in Node.js due to its non-standard callback interface and potential for race conditions. Instead, consider using fs.promises.access or fs.accessSync to check for the existence of a file.

Recommendation:

Replace:

typescript
Copy
Edit
const exists = promisify(fs.exists);
With:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { access } from 'fs/promises';
// Usage
try {
  await access(filePath);
  // File exists
} catch {
  // File does not exist
}
This approach aligns with modern Node.js practices and avoids potential issues associated with deprecated methods.

2. Handling Python Script Output
In your runPythonScript function within video.ts, you're attempting to parse JSON output from the Python script by searching for lines that start and end with curly braces. This method can be fragile, especially if the Python script outputs logs or other information to stdout.

Recommendation:

Modify your Python scripts to output only the JSON result to stdout and direct all logs and debug information to stderr. This separation ensures that your Node.js code can reliably parse the JSON output without interference from log messages.

In your Python scripts:

python
Copy
Edit
import sys
import json

# Your processing logic here

# Output the result to stdout
print(json.dumps(result))

# For logs, use stderr
print("This is a log message", file=sys.stderr)
Then, in your Node.js code, you can safely parse stdout as JSON without additional parsing logic.

3. Error Handling in Python Scripts
In your video_processor.py and tts_processor.py scripts, ensure that all exceptions are properly caught and that meaningful error messages are returned. This practice aids in debugging and provides clearer insights into any issues that arise during execution.

Recommendation:

Wrap your main processing logic in try-except blocks and provide detailed error messages:

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    # Main processing logic
except Exception as e:
    error_message = f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"
    print(json.dumps({"error": error_message}))
    sys.exit(1)
This approach ensures that any errors are communicated back to the Node.js process in a structured manner.
