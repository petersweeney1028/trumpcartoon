Hey team — I need help debugging an issue in our custom media player for RemixTalk.

❗Problem
The video and audio segments aren’t syncing properly across segments. Sometimes:

The audio plays while the wrong video is visible

Segments aren’t transitioning cleanly

Videos are looping or overlapping incorrectly

This seems to stem from how the playSegment function triggers playback per segment and how transitions are handled using timers and boundary tracking.

✅ What’s Working
We are correctly loading 4 video segments (trump1, zelensky, trump2, vance)

We are correctly loading 4 corresponding audio tracks

Each video/audio pair has its own element, stacked and toggled by opacity

⚠️ Suspected Issues
Videos are looping via .loop = true, but we don’t actually want them to loop — they should stop when audio ends, and the next segment should begin.

Timing drift between audio playback time and Date.now()-based transitions — small desyncs accumulate.

Timer restarts on segment transitions might be creating frame drops or async race conditions.

Video visibility is managed by setting opacity, not display or pause() — previous videos might still be playing silently underneath.

💡 Suggested Fixes
Set .loop = false on all videos — these are fixed-duration clips, we want them to play once per audio segment.

In playSegment, call .pause() and reset .currentTime = 0 on all video and audio elements before starting the current one — this prevents overlapping media state.

Track segment end using audio.ended or .duration, not only wall clock time — this gives tighter sync and simpler transitions.

Ensure only one video/audio element is actively playing at any time.

✅ Goal
Clean transitions across the 4 segments:

Video and audio start at the same time

Both play once for their duration

When a segment ends, the next segment starts immediately

Final segment ends cleanly (no auto-loop or stuck playback)

Let me know if you want me to simplify the logic into a single controller loop instead of per-segment play logic.
